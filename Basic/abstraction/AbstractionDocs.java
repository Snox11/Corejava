 * -------Abstraction--------
 * #Process of implementation details in the program
 * is known as abstraction(Hiding how the code actually works)
 * 
 * 
 * #To achieve abstraction :
 * 
 * a>Abstract class :
 * #Class which contains abstract methods(Unemplemented method) 
 * and non-abstract methods is known as abstract class
 * 
 * #Abstract method :
 * -> method which does not have body/implementation
 *  
 * e.g.
 * abstract void print(){
 * 
 * }
 * abstract int getArea(int l,int b);{
 * 
 * }
 * #every abstract class must have ateast one child class
 *  and child class must overwrite abstract methods
 * 
 * #we cannot create object of abstract class.
 * #Level of abstraction 0-100%
 * 
 * #syntax :
 * abstract class class_name{
 * 
 * // abstract methods 
 * e.g.
 * abstract void sum(){
 * 
 * }
 * // non-abstract methods or normal methods 
 * e.g.
 * void print(){
 * 
 * }
 * b>Interface :
 * 
 * #same as class which contains public abstract methods and 
 * public static final variables.
 * 
 * #every interface must have atleast one implementation class and implementation 
 * and class must override abstract methods
 * 
 *#we cannot create object of interface.
 #level of abstraction 100%

 #syntax :
 interface interface_name{
    // public abstract methods
 }
